## Description: üìù
This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to classify chloride-induced damage in concrete using a dataset of images. The model aims to assist in identifying and categorizing damage levels to aid in the maintenance and evaluation of concrete structures.

## Project Summary üìö
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust CNN capable of accurately classifying various levels of chloride damage in concrete. This tool will be invaluable for researchers and engineers focused on infrastructure safety and durability.

## Dataset Description üî•
The dataset includes images of concrete samples with varying levels of chloride-induced damage. Each image is labeled with the corresponding damage level, facilitating supervised learning for model training.

## Benefits for the Machine Learning Community ‚ú®
Benchmarking: Use this dataset to evaluate the performance of different CNN models in classifying chloride damage in concrete.
Model Development: Train and develop new models to improve accuracy in damage classification, contributing to better maintenance strategies for concrete structures.

## Repository Contents ‚úçÔ∏è
Civil-damage-dataset: Directory containing the images of concrete samples divided in train, testing, and validation.

Model.py: Script for training the CNN model.
